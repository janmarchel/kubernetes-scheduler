# Project Title

Time-Series Forecasting with Prophet and InfluxDB

## Description

This project employs Facebook's Prophet library for forecasting time-series data, coupled with InfluxDB for efficient data storage and retrieval. It's ideal for scenarios requiring accurate time-series predictions and robust data management.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To utilize the forecasting model:

1. Configure your InfluxDB settings and Prophet model parameters in `config.py`.
2. If you have a specific time-series dataset, ensure it's placed within the project directory.
3. Adapt `main.py` to reference your dataset and identify the target time series for forecasting.
4. Run the following command to initiate the forecasting:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

This setup will use Prophet to analyze your time-series data, generate forecasts, and store these predictions in InfluxDB for further analysis or visualization.
